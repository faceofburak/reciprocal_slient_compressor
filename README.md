<h2>Project Description</h2>
An air compressor is a machine that converts electrical power into potential energy stored as compressed air. This compressed air is used to power tools, machinery, and equipment in various industrial and commercial applications. There are several types of air compressors such as reciprocating, rotary, and centrifugal. The main difference between them is the method they use to compress air. Our air compressor is a reciprocating air compressor that uses two pistons to compress the air. Pistons increase the efficiency of air compression manipulating air more effectively into the compressor.

<h2>Disassembly</h2>
During the disassembly, we encountered some challenges such as separating the shaft and the pistons from other components. We used a tool called “puller” and separated the shrink-fitted rotor and discs. In total, the disassembly of parts took approximately 2 hours.
After the disassembly, all of our group members bought a caliper to measure their parts. Some troubles occurred during the measurements as well. For instance, it was challenging to measure the dimensions where the caliper wouldn’t fit. We had to come up with practical solutions such as inserting pencil leads into the holes and measuring them.

<h2>Assembly and Exploded View</h2>
We had 64 unique parts and we assembled them all virtually in Siemens NX. We used fix, concentric, touch align, parallel, and align lock as constraints. 
Fix: We used fix constraints for the parts with no motion such as the main body of the compressor: and the air tank.
Concentric: The most frequently used constraint in our assembly is concentric because we had a lot of parts connected by screws. 
Touch Align: When two parts have faces that are touching each other, we have used the touch align constraint to assemble them.
	Align lock: Align lock constraints were used in our assembly when the desired assembly required two parts to have the same axis.
	The most difficult challenge we faced during the assembly process was dimension differences between two parts that needed to be connected. When such a problem occurred we went back to the modeling and fixed the problem. However, sometimes it was hard to update models. Thus, it took time and required effort.

<h2>Modeling and Drafting of Important Parts</h2>
<h4> 1 - Air Tank (Designer: Dora Köksal)</h4>
To model the main body of the tank revolve command was used, then to add some of the features datum planes were created as there were many details with angled positioning. To model the holder sweep along guide command was used with many guides along angled sketches. Additionally, some edge blends, chamfers, and hole commands were used to model the part as similar to the real product as possible.

The drafting of this part includes 2 sheets as it is a detailed part with many features requiring many detailed views. Some dimensional tolerances were defined aligning with the manufacturing processes of the product. Also, some form tolerances were introduced such as concentricity, parallelity, flatness, and profile.

<h4> 2 - Piston (Designer: Dora Köksal)</h4>
To model this part mainly extrude and revolve commands are used and for the details chamfer, edge blend, rib, and hole commands are used. As some details were symmetric, mirror and pattern commands were utilized too.

The drafting of this part includes 2 sheets as it has many details on every face requiring many views with many detailed views. Again some dimensional tolerances, form tolerances, and a surface roughness tolerance were defined for this part to operate properly.
